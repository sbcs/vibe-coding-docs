# How will you make your own prompt

Ask Claude or ChatGPT (AI of your choice!)


'''
You are tasked with writing a highly detailed prompt for Loveable, an AI tool that generates full web applications from scratch.

Requirements for your output:
- The prompt should describe a website or web app with <x,y,z> features that I provide.
- For each feature, break down the user interactions, data flow, UI components, and error handling in detail.
- Always include:
  - Frontend technologies (React + TailwindCSS)
  - Styling guidelines (colors, typography, spacing, rounded corners, shadows, etc.)
  - Accessibility requirements (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
  - Extra flourishes (animations, responsiveness, search, dark mode toggle, etc.)
- End with explicit instructions about the final deliverable (a complete working React app, modular code, comments).

Do not generate code â€” only produce the **Loveable prompt** in text form.

Replace <x,y,z> with the topic of your choice
Then, copy paste the prompt into Loveable!!!

Again, vibe coding to the max! (did you write any code?)
- Maybe philosophically English is a programming language....
