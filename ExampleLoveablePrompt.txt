"Build a fully interactive web application for visualizing and managing teams in a company. The app should display each manager as a large circle placed inside a rectangular container (the rectangle represents the manager’s group). Inside each rectangle, show the workers as smaller circles arranged neatly around the manager’s circle.

I want the following functionality:

Drag and Drop:

Workers should be draggable between rectangles to reassign them to different managers.

When a worker is dropped into a new group, the UI should automatically update to show them inside the new manager’s rectangle.

Include smooth animations so the movement feels fluid and intuitive.

Merging Managers:

Allow two manager rectangles to be merged by dragging one rectangle onto another.

When merged, their rectangles combine into a single larger rectangle containing both managers and all of their workers.

The layout should re-balance automatically to prevent overlap and maintain clarity.

Dynamic Updates:

As workers are moved or groups are merged, the display should update in real-time.

Ensure transitions (adding/removing/merging) have subtle animations for polish.

UI and Styling:

Use a clean, modern interface with a white/light gray background, soft shadows, and rounded corners.

Worker circles should be smaller but distinct, with hover tooltips showing their name.

Manager circles should be larger and labeled with the manager’s name at the center.

Rectangles should resize automatically to fit their contents.

Important: Use Stony Brook University’s colors as the theme — primary Red (#990000) and Black (#000000), with white as a neutral background.

Extra Features (if possible):

Add a search bar at the top to quickly find a worker and highlight the group they belong to.

Provide a button to “add new manager” (creates a new rectangle + circle) and “add new worker” (adds a worker circle into a group).

Include a reset button that returns all workers and managers to the initial state.

The final app should feel smooth, professional, and user-friendly, optimized for both desktop and tablet use."
